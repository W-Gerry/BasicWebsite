            Accessibility
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe a key aspect of web development is creating applications that as many people as possible are able to access and use <em>as intended</em>. Ensuring that accessibility concepts are considered during the development process is key to a successful application.

            <li>Operable</li>

            Responsive design
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to ensuring that web applications are accessible, it is important to recognise that there are a wide variety of devices and operating systems that need to be able to interact with your application so applying Responsive Design principles throughout the entire development process is also crucial.
